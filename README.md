Moblie Defense : Android ADB Commands for Privacy and Cybersecurity

These adb commands are for GrapheneOS users who may want to enhance 
their privacy by limiting interactions with thier personal area network.

Removing these packages will make a GrapheneOS mobile phone setup restrictive.

If you are a person that is concerned with mobile device privacy and security 
intrusion defense, these adb commands may be of assistance.

I have to comment on the removal of emergency and health service packages since 
I do not want to be liable for anything that may happen to someone who uses 
these commands and may not understand the ramifications of consequence.

Disclaimer : Remove these services at your own risk. 

Otherwise, the benefit to removing them is that there is less of a chance of 
receiving a "ping" so to speak on your mobile device via emergency services 
communications.
